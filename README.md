# OpenSource 3d Base Models
## This repository Contains 3d models created for the express purpose of being opensource and Free to use, Please if you are using these models for your own projects a shout out would be appreacated but is NEVER manadatory.
If you'd like to contribue to the Mission of making Free And Opensource 3d Base models, Please Fork and add your 3d model to a new folder along with an Image of the model since viewing Pngs is easier than Viewing 3d models, Also include a wireframe view of your model for a Tapologue check.

All Models that will or are in this Repo are required to have Decent Quad or Tri Tapologue and an Open source License, Although if you wish to you can add more to your models, But the base line is an .OBJ but a .FBX is the perfered file type for any base models.

If your model is being used in this repository without your permission or against your wishes, Please Open up an Issue and hopefully I'll be able to help you.
